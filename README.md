# ExperienceSampler
An open-source smartphone app designed for experience sampling developed using Cordova

To customize ExperienceSampler, please see our website www.experiencesampler.com

Try out an ExperienceSampler app at https://sabrinathai.github.io/ExperienceSamplerDownload/. You can download a short version of an ExperienceSampler app that includes all the features.

This clone of the original repository includes a Docker file that can be used to create a Docker image to host the data collection script. Note that the docker image is designed to operate on port 8080 by default and allows for being run as any user who is in the root group. This allows the container to run on an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster.
