# ExperienceSampler
An open-source smartphone app designed for experience sampling developed using Cordova

To customize ExperienceSampler, please see our website www.experiencesampler.com

Try out an ExperienceSampler app at https://sabrinathai.github.io/ExperienceSamplerDownload/. You can download a short version of an ExperienceSampler app that includes all the features.

This repository includes a Dockerfile that can be used to create a Docker image to host the data collection script. Note that the docker image is designed to run Apache on port 8080 by default and allows for being run by any user who is in the root group. This allows the container to be run on an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster. You can learn more about Docker containers at https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container.
